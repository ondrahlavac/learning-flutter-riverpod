# Learning Flutter Riverpod

A simple excercise project to get Riverpod under my skin.

## Goals

Let's create a simple skeleton application. For each Riverpod function or a concept, we're going to complete an excercise showing the usage of the function in the way it works the best.

## Getting Started

- clone the repo
- checkout the first tag which should be a starting point with an empty skeleton
- each next tag should build on top of the previous one


Let's dive into in. We'll see how it works. ;-)
